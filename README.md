## 📊 **Advanced Statistical Calculations**

### **Dynamic Baseline System**
Our platform employs a methodical approach to statistical baselines that evolve with league performance:

```javascript
// Dynamic WAR Baseline Calculation (Updates every 50 games)
const calculateDynamicWAR = (playerStats, leagueBaseline) => {
  const replacement = leagueBaseline.percentile_20; // Replacement level
  const average = leagueBaseline.percentile_50;     // Average level
  const elite = leagueBaseline.percentile_90;       // Elite level
  
  return ((playerStats.totalValue - replacement) / 
          (average - replacement)) * baselineWAR;
};
```

### **Contract Value Rating (CVR)**  
True contract value analysis using actual MLB salary data:

```javascript  
// Contract Value Rating - Performance vs Investment
const calculateCVR = (playerWAR, actualSalary, marketValue) => {
  const expectedWAR = actualSalary / marketValue.dollarPerWAR;
  return playerWAR / expectedWAR;
  
  // CVR Scale:
  // 1.8+ = Elite Value    | 1.2-1.8 = Star Value  
  // 0.8-1.2 = Good Value  | 0.5-0.8 = Poor Value  
  // <0.5 = Negative Value
};
```

### **Advanced Sabermetrics**
Professional-grade calculations matching MLB standards:

```javascript
// Fielding Independent Pitching (FIP)  
const FIP = ((13 * HR + 3 * (BB + HBP) - 2 * SO) / IP) + FIP_CONSTANT;

// Batting Average on Balls In Play (BABIP)
const BABIP = (H - HR) / (AB - SO - HR + SF);

// Weighted On-Base Average (wOBA)  
const wOBA = (uBB*BB + uHBP*HBP + u1B*1B + u2B*2B + u3B*3B + uHR*HR) / 
             (AB + BB - IBB + SF + HBP);
```
