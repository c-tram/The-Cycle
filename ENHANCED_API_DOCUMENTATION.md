# Enhanced Backend API Documentation v2.0
## Professional Baseball Statistics API

### Overview
The enhanced v2 API provides comprehensive baseball statistics with professional-grade calculations, advanced metrics, detailed analytics, and **exhaustive situational splits analysis**. All endpoints support the complete statistical structure implemented in `pullBoxscoresToRedis_v2.cjs` and the new `pullPlayByPlaySplits.cjs` for comprehensive splits data.

**Mission**: Testing every possible baseball statistic that is imaginable with complete linkage between boxscores and situational performance.

### Base URL Structure
- **v1 (Legacy)**: `/api/{endpoint}` - Basic statistics with limited calculations
- **v2 (Enhanced)**: `/api/v2/{endpoint}` - Professional-grade statistics with advanced metrics
- **v2 Splits**: `/api/v2/splits/{category}` - **NEW** Situational analytics with play-by-play granularity

## üÜï SPLITS ANALYSIS API (/api/v2/splits)

### Comprehensive Split Categories
The splits system extracts 7+ major categories of situational performance from MLB play-by-play data:

#### **1. Home/Away Performance** - `/api/v2/splits/home-away`
Player performance based on home vs away games
```
Redis Key Pattern: split:home-away:TEAM-PLAYER_NAME-YEAR:home|away
Example: split:home-away:HOU-Jose_Altuve-2025:home
```

#### **2. Venue-Specific Performance** - `/api/v2/splits/venue`
Player performance at specific ballparks with home/away context
```
Redis Key Pattern: split:venue:TEAM-PLAYER_NAME-YEAR:vs:VENUE_NAME:home|away
Example: split:venue:NYY-Aaron_Judge-2025:vs:Yankee_Stadium:home
```

#### **3. Player vs Team Matchups** - `/api/v2/splits/player-team`
Player performance against specific opposing teams
```
Redis Key Pattern: split:player-team:TEAM-PLAYER_NAME-YEAR:vs:OPPONENT:home|away
Example: split:player-team:LAD-Mookie_Betts-2025:vs:SF:away
```

#### **4. Batter vs Pitcher Matchups** - `/api/v2/splits/batter-pitcher`
Individual head-to-head performance with complete game linkage
```
Redis Key Pattern: split:batter-pitcher:BATTER_TEAM-BATTER_NAME-YEAR:vs:PITCHER_TEAM-PITCHER_NAME:home|away
Example: split:batter-pitcher:NYY-Aaron_Judge-2025:vs:HOU-Justin_Verlander:away
```

#### **5. Handedness Splits (Batting)** - `/api/v2/splits/batter-handedness`
Batter performance vs left/right-handed pitching
```
Redis Key Pattern: split:batter-hand:TEAM-PLAYER_NAME-YEAR:vs:L|R:home|away
Example: split:batter-hand:BOS-Rafael_Devers-2025:vs:L:home
```

#### **6. Handedness Splits (Pitching)** - `/api/v2/splits/pitcher-handedness`
Pitcher performance vs left/right-handed batters
```
Redis Key Pattern: split:pitcher-hand:TEAM-PLAYER_NAME-YEAR:vs:L|R:home|away
Example: split:pitcher-hand:NYY-Gerrit_Cole-2025:vs:R:home
```

#### **7. Team vs Team Matchups** - `/api/v2/splits/team-matchup`

```
Redis Key Pattern: split:team-matchup:TEAM_A:vs:TEAM_B:YEAR:home|away
Example: split:team-matchup:NYY:vs:BOS:2025:home
```

#### **8. Game-Specific Linkage** - `/api/v2/splits/game-specific`
Direct connections between splits and individual game boxscores
```
Redis Key Pattern: split-game:GAMEID-DATE:batter-pitcher:BATTER_NAME:vs:PITCHER_NAME
Example: split-game:776685-2025-08-19:batter-pitcher:Jose_Altuve:vs:Tarik_Skubal
```

### Splits Data Structure
Each split contains comprehensive statistical data with game linkage:
```json

## üèóÔ∏è COMPLETE REDIS ARCHITECTURE

### Key Patterns Overview
The Cycle uses a comprehensive Redis key architecture supporting traditional boxscores, advanced statistics, and exhaustive splits analysis:

#### **Boxscore Keys (Existing)**
```bash
# Player Performance
player:TEAM-PLAYER_NAME-YEAR:DATE-GAMEID     # Individual game stats with doubleheader support
player:TEAM-PLAYER_NAME-YEAR:season          # Season aggregations with 40+ statistical categories

# Team Performance  
team:TEAM:YEAR:DATE-GAMEID                   # Team game stats with doubleheader support
team:TEAM:YEAR:season                        # Team season aggregations

# Salary Data
salary:TEAM-PLAYER_NAME-YEAR                 # Player salary information (1,740+ records)

# Legacy Matchups
player-vs-team:TEAM-PLAYER_NAME-YEAR:vs:OPPONENT:average  # Basic matchup averages
```

#### **Splits Keys (NEW - Comprehensive Situational Analysis)**
```bash
# HOME/AWAY PERFORMANCE
split:home-away:TEAM-PLAYER_NAME-YEAR:home
split:home-away:TEAM-PLAYER_NAME-YEAR:away

# VENUE-SPECIFIC PERFORMANCE  
split:venue:TEAM-PLAYER_NAME-YEAR:vs:VENUE_NAME:home
split:venue:TEAM-PLAYER_NAME-YEAR:vs:VENUE_NAME:away
split:venue:TEAM-PLAYER_NAME-YEAR:vs:VENUE_NAME:total

# PLAYER vs TEAM MATCHUPS (Enhanced)
split:player-team:TEAM-PLAYER_NAME-YEAR:vs:OPPONENT:home  
split:player-team:TEAM-PLAYER_NAME-YEAR:vs:OPPONENT:away
split:player-team:TEAM-PLAYER_NAME-YEAR:vs:OPPONENT:total

# BATTER vs PITCHER HEAD-TO-HEAD
split:batter-pitcher:BATTER_TEAM-BATTER_NAME-YEAR:vs:PITCHER_TEAM-PITCHER_NAME:home
split:batter-pitcher:BATTER_TEAM-BATTER_NAME-YEAR:vs:PITCHER_TEAM-PITCHER_NAME:away  
split:batter-pitcher:BATTER_TEAM-BATTER_NAME-YEAR:vs:PITCHER_TEAM-PITCHER_NAME:total

# HANDEDNESS SPLITS
split:batter-hand:TEAM-PLAYER_NAME-YEAR:vs:L:home        # vs Left-handed pitching  
split:batter-hand:TEAM-PLAYER_NAME-YEAR:vs:R:away        # vs Right-handed pitching
split:pitcher-hand:TEAM-PLAYER_NAME-YEAR:vs:L:home       # vs Left-handed batters
split:pitcher-hand:TEAM-PLAYER_NAME-YEAR:vs:R:away       # vs Right-handed batters

# TEAM vs TEAM ORGANIZATIONAL MATCHUPS
split:team-matchup:TEAM_A:vs:TEAM_B:YEAR:home
split:team-matchup:TEAM_A:vs:TEAM_B:YEAR:away
split:team-matchup:TEAM_A:vs:TEAM_B:YEAR:total

# GAME-SPECIFIC LINKAGE (Boxscore Integration)
split-game:GAMEID-DATE:batter-pitcher:BATTER_NAME:vs:PITCHER_NAME
split-game:GAMEID-DATE:player-team:PLAYER_NAME:vs:OPPONENT:home
split-game:GAMEID-DATE:handedness:PLAYER_NAME:vs:L:away
```

#### **Indexing Keys (Cross-Reference System)**
```bash
# Game to Splits Mapping
game-splits-index:GAMEID                    # All splits for a specific game

# Player to Splits Mapping  
player-splits-index:TEAM-PLAYER_NAME-YEAR:GAMEID:available:[split-types]

# Reverse Lookup Support
boxscore-splits-linkage:TEAM-PLAYER_NAME-YEAR:GAMEID:[linked-splits]
```

### Key Architecture Benefits
