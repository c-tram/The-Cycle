git commit -m "feat: Complete live boxscore system with real-time updates, comprehensive stats, and animated play-by-play

✨ Major Features Added:
- Full boxscore component with 4 tabs (Overview, Batting, Pitching, Play-by-Play)
- Live score updates with auto-refresh every 15s for active games
- Real-time play-by-play with 10s refresh and notification animations
- Comprehensive batting/pitching statistics via enhanced MLB API integration
- Dedicated boxscore pages accessible via /boxscore/:gameId/:date routes

🔧 Technical Improvements:
- Enhanced MLB API proxy with detailed player statistics extraction
- Framer Motion animations for new play notifications and live indicators
- Status-based game sorting (Live → Final → Warmup) as default
- Timezone-aware date handling to fix UTC conversion issues
- React Hooks compliance with proper null safety and error handling

🐛 Critical Fixes:
- Fixed timezone bug causing wrong date fetches (UTC vs local time)
- Resolved React Hooks ordering violations with conditional returns
- Added comprehensive null checks for game data and MLB API responses
- Fixed variable declaration conflicts and missing imports

🎯 User Experience:
- Multi-access boxscore system (modal from LiveScoreboard + dedicated pages)
- Professional baseball analytics interface with team colors and logos
- Live updating scores with pulsing indicators for active games
- Sortable play-by-play with chronological/recent view options
- Auto-refresh controls with visual feedback for new plays
